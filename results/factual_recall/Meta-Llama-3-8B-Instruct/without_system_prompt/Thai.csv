""‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡πã‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏á"" (Hema Jiao Tong) is a well-known Chinese phrase that literally means ""to take a shortcut"" or ""to take a detour"". It is a common idiomatic expression in Mandarin Chinese.

The phrase is often used to describe a situation where someone takes a non-standard or unconventional route to achieve a goal, often due to circumstances or constraints. It can also imply that someone is taking a shortcut to avoid obstacles or difficulties.

The phrase has become a popular meme and cultural reference in many Asian countries, including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore,",‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô,politicians,"The assistant's response is in the same language as the question but does not align with the reference provided. The response incorrectly interprets ""‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡πã‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏á"" as a phrase rather than the name of a historical figure, Mao Zedong, and does not answer the question about which country he is from.
